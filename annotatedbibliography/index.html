Murphy, Paul P. "Satellite images show craters at alleged Syrian chemical weapons facilities." CNN, 14 Apr. 2018, www.cnn.com/2018/04/14/us/satellite-images-syrian-airstrikes/index.html. Accessed 4 Feb. 2020. 
	This is a primary source, because images are primary sources, and that is the only part being used.
	These images were published by CNN, which is a major news organization in the US. They appear to have published this to show that the Syrians are wrong in saying that there wasn't any damage. The images show the effects of war, and how only a few specific buildings were damaged.
