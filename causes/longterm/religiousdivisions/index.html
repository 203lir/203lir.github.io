		A major cause of the conflict against Assad is the religious divisions of Syria.
		</h3>
		<p>
		Most Syrians are Sunni Arabs, but the Assad family are Alawites, which is a Shiite offshoot. The rest of the Assad regime is also not Sunni, and is frequently called a "coalition of minorities".

		The religious divisions are also shown by who is protesting against Assad; "while the early anti-Assad demonstrations were sometimes multiethnic and multireligious, "the armed rebels are Sunni to a man."" (Ted Galen Carpenter)  This division between ethnic majorities and ethnic minorities, like in so many other countries, is a huge source of tension. The Sunnis have suffered such extreme regime violence, that they can be expected to fight to the end (Ted Galen Carpenter), which is one reason that the war continues to drag on, with no clear solution. But even before that, when protests were just starting, the Assad regime reacted to those peaceful protests with violence, which caused small militias to form, (Channel 4 News) kicking off the war.
