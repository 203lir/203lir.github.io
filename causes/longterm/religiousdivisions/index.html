		A major cause of the conflict against Assad is the religious divisions of Syria.
		</h3>
		<p>
		Most Syrians are Sunni Arabs, but the Assad family are Alawites, which is a Shiite offshoot. The rest of the Assad regime is also not Sunni, and is frequently called a "coalition of minorities".

		<p>
		The religious divisions are also shown by who is protesting against Assad; "while the early anti-Assad demonstrations were sometimes multiethnic and multireligious, "the armed rebels are Sunni to a man."" (Ted Galen Carpenter)  The result of these divisions is that the Syrian civil war is a "coalition of minorities" fighting Sunnis, with help from other countries.
