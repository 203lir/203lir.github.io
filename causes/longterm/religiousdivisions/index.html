	Effect of Religion on Syrian Civil War

		<h3>
		A major cause of the conflict against Assad is the religious divisions of Syria.
		</h3>
		<h4>
		Religious divisions
		</h4>
		<p>
		Most Syrians are Sunni Arabs, but the Assad family are Alawites, which is a Shiite offshoot. The rest of the Assad regime is also not Sunni, and is frequently called a "coalition of minorities".

		<p>
		The religious divisions are also shown by who is protesting against Assad; "while the early anti-Assad demonstrations were sometimes multiethnic and multireligious, "the armed rebels are Sunni to a man."" (Ted Galen Carpenter) 
		</p>
		<h4>
		Ethnic divisions
		</h4>
		<p>
		This division between ethnic majorities and ethnic minorities, like in so many other countries, is a huge source of tension. Another example of this is the United States currently, although the group which is protesting in the US is a minority, compared to the ethnic majority protesting in Syria. Black people in the US have been discriminated against, and harmed by the government. Arab Sunnis have suffered such extreme regime violence that a war started, which continues to drag on. 
		</p>
		<h4>
		Extremity of violence
		</h4>
		<p>
		The war hasn't ended yet because of how extreme the violence was; the Sunnis can be expected to fight till the end. (International Crisis Group) But even before that, when protests were just starting, the Assad regime reacted to those peaceful protests with violence, (Channel 4 News) as well as jailing and torturing anyone believed to be an opposition activist. (Secunder Kermani) This caused militias to form, starting the war.
