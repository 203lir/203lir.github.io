		Russia
		</h3>
		<p>
		Russia has clear reasons to try to keep Assad in power, in order to benefit their military. Russia's only military installation in the Mediterranean region is at the Syrian port of Tartus (Ted Galen Carpenter), which would most likely cease to exist if the Assad regime fell. This naval base is very important to Russia in order to remain a global superpower, as without this base, Russia can not fight in the Mediterranean. Russia has had these strategic ties with Syria since the Soviet Union, when Syria was led by Hafez al-Assad, who is the father of Bashar Assad. During the Cold War, Russia supplied Syria with vast amounts of economic and military aid, (Ted Galen Carpenter) and there is no reason to believe that they will not continue to do so.

		<h3>
		China
		</h3>
		<p>
		China's motivations to participate are much less strong, as it is purely economic. "China was Syria's largest trading partner in 2011, with Syrian exports to that country totaling more than $2.4 billion. China is also a major participant in Syria's oil industry" (Ted Galen Carpenter)
		</p>
		<h3>
		United States
		</h3>
		<p>
		The United States itself has no reason to participate in Syria, other than to supposedly "save the people". However, it's allies have their own reasons to want to remove Assad, and the US wants to keep Russia from gaining power.
