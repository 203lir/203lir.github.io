		What finally ignited the bed of tinder which is Syria were the human rights violations and political repression by the Assad regime.
		</h3>
		<p>
		The human rights violations and political repression of the Assad regime are both a short term and long term issue. They were what finally started the war, and also why the war continues today. Anyone suspected of being an opposition activist was jailed and tortured, while being "interrogated". "Farah" tells the story of being jailed in an interview published by the BBC. She says that during interrogations, "They hit you and they ask you the question, if you don't answer they hit you more." (Secunder Kermani) This is not uncommon, and while Assad may be doing this to discourage rebels, its effect is only to anger the rebels. Another possibly much worse example of human rights violations by the Assad regime is its chemical weapons program.

		Chemical weapons have been banned for humanitarian reasons since the 1920s, but they are still used by Assad against rebel held villages. Civilians are most affected, and this use of chemical weapons only worsens the refugee crisis.
