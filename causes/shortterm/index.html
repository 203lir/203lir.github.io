		What finally ignited the bed of tinder which is Syria were the human rights violations and political repression by the Assad regime.
		</h3>
		<p>
		The Assad regime has had many human rights violations, mostly against those who oppose the regime. This is also another reason that the war continues today; "its (the opposition) core constituency has suffered such extreme regime violence that it can be expected to fight till the end" (International Crisis Group) This violence is what Syrians were protesting against. In response to these peaceful protests, the Syrian government reacted with violence, and militias formed. (Channel 4 News)
